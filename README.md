# Personality Predictor

This project predicts **MBTI personality traits from Reddit text** using multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches.  
It includes a full pipeline for scraping Reddit data, building a labeled dataset from user flairs, preprocessing text, and training several models ranging from TF-IDF baselines to transformer-based models and LLM fine-tuning.

The **notebooks directory contains exploratory experiments** used during development.  
The **main reproducible pipeline** is implemented in the `data_pipeline` and `models` directories.

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to **predict MBTI personality dimensions from Reddit user text**.

The model predicts the four MBTI dimensions:

| Dimension | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `target_1` | Extroversion (E) vs Introversion (I) |
| `target_2` | Intuition (N) vs Sensing (S) |
| `target_3` | Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F) |
| `target_4` | Perceiving (P) vs Judging (J) |

MBTI labels are extracted from **Reddit user flairs**, and comments from each author are aggregated to build training samples.

## Pipeline

### 1. Scrape Reddit data
python data_pipeline/scrape_reddit_pullpush.py
### 2. Build MBTI dataset
python data_pipeline/build_reddit_dataset.py
### 3. Process data
python data_pipeline/process_data.py
### 4. Train models
python models/train_tfidf_xgboost.py
python models/train_nn_bert.py
python models/fine_tune_bert.py
python models/deberta_tuning.py
python models/deberta_tuning_optuna.py
python models/fine_tune_Mistral.py

## Installation

Python **3.11**
pip install -r requirements.txt


---

## Hardware

CPU is sufficient for preprocessing and classical models.

GPU is recommended for transformer and LLM training.  
Development experiments used an **NVIDIA RTX 3090**.

---

## Data

If the Reddit dataset is not included in the repository, you can:

- run the scraping pipeline
- request the dataset from the project author
